### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm currently learning web development and programming as a whole, my motivation is derived from curiosity and my aim is to build a career which will provide me with a meaningful and fulfilling life by walking into the unknown. ðŸ”­
  
- I never handled any experience out in the real world, my knowledge is derived from self studying. ðŸŒ±
  
- So far.. I have some knowledge on front end development as a whole which inludes JavaScript, HTML and CSS. ðŸ‘¯
  
- I completed front-end projects which I consider to be fundamental into getting my knowledge up, projects I did includes a people counter app, a basic blackjack game, a simple calculator and the most challenging so far a chrome extension, all of them styled accordingly. I learnt js data types, manipulating the DOM in html, basic styling in CSS etc, and I'm ready to expand my knowledge. ðŸŒ±
  
- I have very basic python knowledge as I pursued it at the end of the Javascript course I completed over youtube. ðŸ“«
  
- I created a github account hoping I could sharpen my programming skills through learning and sharing knowledge as well as collaborating with fellow programmers, reach out if see this.ðŸ’¬
  
- I never worked in a team on a project before and I'm hoping I can turn into a reality soon. ðŸ¤”

- One of my goals involves exploring my potential of what could be through commitment, hopefully I will find some guidance within the github community which will allow me to grow further. âœ¨

- I hope to utilize and learn AI in the near future, as it deals with simplicity. âœ¨ 

- I've always enjoyed helping people with technical problems, which is my current profession, I also developed an eagerness to provide feedback on improvements and bug fixes to developers of my favorite apps, that's when I realised that the world needs more programmers and developers to simplify digital life in a period where everything has been invented. ðŸŒ±

- Last and well least, thank you for reading, if in result of any visitors. ðŸ˜„ P.S I'm not the best writer or story teller.
